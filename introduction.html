            <h2>Welcome to the Family Worship Guide</h2>
            <p>
                This worship guide is designed to help you <strong><em>plan</em></strong> and <strong><em>exercise</em></strong> the spiritual disciplines that lead to growth in grace and faith in Jesus Christ. Following this guide you will read the whole Bible, memorize critical passages of Scripture and learn important doctrinal principles from the <strong><em>Father's Catechism</em></strong> a new catechism of the Reformed faith. As you read through this guide, you will notice several things.
            </p>

                <br>
                <br>

            <p> 
                <strong>First</strong>, this is a four-year plam. The scripture and Catechism memory is over four years while in that time you will have read through the Bible in its entirety twice. My hope is that you will be encouraged to continue your journey through the guide without being intimidated by its duration. Year-long or shorter tools can be difficult to complete.
            </p>  
                <br>
            <p>    
                <strong>Second</strong>, the guide is divided into monthly increments. Each month is in three sections:Bible memorization, <strong><em>Father's Catechism</em></strong> questions and a modification of Robert Murray M'Cheyne's Bible reading plan. In four years, you would've memorized 87 foundational Bible verses, 95 catechism questions and read the Old Teastament twice and New Testament four times! The <strong><em>Father's Catechism</em></strong> is a new catechism based on the <strong><em>Westminster Shorter Catechism</em></strong>. I wrote the <strong><em>Catechism</em></strong> with the intent of making the majestic doctrines of our holy faith more accessable for all  ages in modern English.
            </p>
                <br>            
            <p>
                <strong>Third</strong>, in the Bible reading plans, there are two columns: "family" and "private." These are M'Chayne's original designations. The "family" reading is for family devotions, while the "private" is for personal devotions. You are <strong><em>strongly encourgaed</em></strong> to adopt these readings in both your family worship and personal devotions. If you don't use this guide for family worship, then I would recommend you read both listed texts for personal devotion.
            </p>
                <br>
            <p>
                <strong>Fourth</strong>, I include a familiar and favorite set of songs, hymns, or spiritual songs for each month. Taken from the <strong><em>Trinity Hymnal</em></strong>, I've included two hymns per month for the family to learn and to sing. Our hymnody in the Presbyterian and Reformed faith is rich with lyrics that soar about the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Learn and sing together!
            </p>
                <br>
            <p>
                <strong>Lastly</strong>, <strong><em>record your progress!</em></strong> Inevitably, our reading gets interrupted by seasons of family life, illness, or travle. Don's despair! Once you return to your guide, just pick up at the correct date or after your last entry.
            </p>
                <br>
            <p>
                <strong>Instructions:</strong>
                <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                As a family,  have each of the members of your family use the "private" Bible reading for daily devotional readings. Gather together - regularly - as a family and read the "family" Bible readings and discuss what you read. As you read, simply answer three questions: "What does this <strong>say</strong>?" "What does this <strong>mean</strong>?" "What does this <strong>matter</strong>?" Have each family member recite and memorize the Bible verses for the two-week increment. Also, recite and memorize the Cateechism question and answer. Sing the hymn either at the beginning or the end (if you don't know the tune, go online to <a href="http://cyberhymnal.org">Cyber Hymnal</a> and listen together).
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                If you get behind, <strong>don't quit!</strong> Just pick up where you left off or at the correct date.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Beloved, God will bless the reading and meditation on His Word. It is the power of God for salvation to all who believe!
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Heaven Soon,
            </p>
